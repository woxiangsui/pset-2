# Problem Set 2

It's time to put your skills to the test. This problem set focuses on programming in JavaScript. More specifically, it focuses on printing text to the console, prompting the user for input, and manipulating that input using operators to solve simple problems.

## Getting Started

To get started, create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository to store your code. When you're finished, clone my skeleton to get all of the starter code and instructions. Setup a remote to push your code to your repository instead of mine.

### Setup

1. Login to your GitHub account and create a new repository named `pset-2`.
2. In the terminal, navigate to your `APCSP` directory on the `Desktop`.
```
$ cd ~/Desktop/APCSP
```
3. Clone my skeleton repository into a directory named `pset-2`.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:ap-principles-ucvts/pset-2-skeleton.git pset-2
````
4. Change into your newly created `pset-2` directory.
```
$ cd pset-2
```
5. Overwrite the remote, which originally points at my skeleton repository.
```
$ git remote rename origin upstream
```
6. Add a new remote that points at your `pset-2` repository. Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual username.
```
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/pset-2.git
```
7. Install the required packages for reading user input. This command should be executed in the `pset-2` folder, and will create a `node_modules` folder that contains everything you need.
```
$ npm install
```
8. Open up the `hello.js` file, which is in the `src` folder. All your `.js` files should go in the `src` folder.

The first exercise is mostly done for you. You just have to fix a few things. You'll be on your own for the rest. There are a lot of exercises in this problem set, but none of them are too challenging. Take your time and try not to get frustrated.

## Exercises

The specifications for each exercise are outlined below. Your job is to write lines of code to solve the problems. Your code must meet the requirements set forth in this section. Each solution must be written in its own file, and named accordingly.

Work through these exercises on your own. Experiment, make mistakes, ask questions, and fix your mistakes. It's the only way to get good at programming.

### Exercise 1

I've written some code in `hello.js`, but it's broken. It's supposed to print a nice message to the console.

### Exercise 5

What is the length of the diagonal (in inches) between two corners on an *l*-by-*w*-inch sheet of paper, where *l* and *w* are provided by the user?

### Exercise 6

Given the grading policy and the homework, quiz, and test grades I provide, what marking period grade will I get?

The grading policy defines the following weights.
* Homework, 15%
* Quizzes, 35%
* Tests, 50%
